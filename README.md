## Overview

A browser-based real-time audiovisual experiment built with **p5.js**.

The project generates animated 3D graphics driven by musical structure, translating rhythm and intensity into evolving spatial behaviour.
It represents some of my earliest work in interactive graphics and is preserved to show the progression toward the larger, production-oriented systems I build today.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Real-time rendering in the browser  
- Audio → visual parameter mapping  
- Dynamic camera & spatial motion  
- Time-synchronised animation behaviours  
- Continuous simulation & render loop
- Interactive control of scene evolution

---

## How It Works

Visual behaviours are derived from deterministic rules driven by the soundtrack.

As musical intensity changes, the program adjusts:

- object motion  
- depth & perspective  
- transformation speed  
- spatial distribution  
- visual density  

Even with relatively simple primitives, the combinations produce complex, evolving sequences.

## Technical Challenges Explored

- Synchronising animation with music  
- Designing mappings that stay readable as intensity increases  
- Avoiding runaway visual complexity  
- Maintaining stable browser performance  

---

## Technologies

- JavaScript  
- p5.js  
- Web Audio

## Repository Context

Created in 2021 during early university study.

The structure reflects rapid experimentation and creative exploration rather than modern production architecture. I keep the project public because it provides a useful reference point for how my engineering approach has developed since.
